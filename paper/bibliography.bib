  abstract                   = {In this paper we develop a novel neural network model for predicting
   implied volatility surface. Prior financial domain knowledge is taken
   into account. A new activation function that incorporates volatility
   smile is proposed, which is used for the hidden nodes that process the
   underlying asset price. In addition, financial conditions, such as the
   absence of arbitrage, the boundaries and the asymptotic slope, are
   embedded into the loss function. This is one of the very first studies
   which discuss a methodological framework that incorporates prior
   financial domain knowledge into neural network architecture design and
   model training. The proposed model outperforms the benchmarked models
   with the option data on the S\&P 500 index over 20 years. More
   importantly, the domain knowledge is satisfied empirically, showing the
   model is consistent with the existing financial theories and conditions
   related to implied volatility surface.},

   calibration task within a few milliseconds for the full implied
   volatility surface. The framework is consistently applicable throughout
   a range of volatility models-including second-generation stochastic
   volatility models and the rough volatility family-and a range of
   derivative contracts. Neural networks in this work are used in an
   off-line approximation of complex pricing functions, which are difficult
   to represent or time-consuming to evaluate by other means. The form in
   which information from available data is extracted and used influences
   network performance: The grid-based algorithm used for calibration is
   inspired by representing the implied volatility and option prices as a
   collection of pixels. We highlight how this perspective opens new
   horizons for quantitative modelling. The calibration bottleneck posed by
   a slow pricing of derivative contracts is lifted, and stochastic
   volatility models (classical and rough) can be handled in great
   generality as the framework also allows taking the forward variance
   curve as an input. We demonstrate the calibration performance both on
   simulated and historical data, on different derivative contracts and on
   a number of example models of increasing complexity, and also showcase
   some of the potentials of this approach towards model recognition. The
   algorithm and examples are provided in the Github repository GitHub:

   is extremely important and has been attempted by researchers and market

   implied from the option prices, are crucial barometers of the market.
   And this research proposes a new approach that combines image processing
   and machine learning to capture the relationships between
   sentiment-related features and asset movement. The proposed research is
   based on the tick-level SPY options transactions, and the dataset
   contains around 1.5 million trading records. Specially, we obtained the
   gap between the call surface and the put surface as the second-level
   implied volatility surface (IVS). After adopting the traditional
   convolutional neural network (CNN) to compare the predictive effects
   among implied volatility (IV) call surface, IV put surface, and IV gap
   surface, the results indicate that the IV gap provides the most
   significant predictability. Besides, our project creatively proposes the
   interframe difference approach to optimized CNN and a recurrent CNN
   (RCNN) to fully utilize spatial and temporal features of the IV surface
   data. According to experiment results, the directional accuracy of
   prediction ranges from 67.20\% to 72.05\% for asset movement forecasting

  abstract                   = {One important parameter in the Black-Scholes option pricing model is the
   implied volatility. Implied volatility surface (IVS) is an important
   concept in finance that describes the variation of implied volatility
   across option strike price and time to maturity. Over the last few
   decades, economists and financialists have long tried to exploit the
   predictability in the IVS using various parametric models, which require
   deep understanding of financial practices in the area. In this paper, we
   explore how a data-driven machine learning method, symbolic regression,
   performs in identifying the implied volatility surface even without deep
   financial knowledge. Two different approaches of symbolic regression are
   explored through a simulation study and an empirical study using a large
   panel of option data in the United States options market.},

   (hard constraints approach) or favor (soft constraints approach) the

   parameters that are needed for adequate performance. A novel component
   is the use of the Dupire formula to enforce bounds on the local
   volatility associated with option prices, during the network fitting.

   First, we select features to represent the surface and predict them.
   Second, we use the predicted features to construct the IVS using a deep
   neural network (DNN) model by incorporating constraints that can prevent
   static arbitrage. We consider three methods to extract features from the
   implied volatility data: principal component analysis, variational
   autoencoder, and sampling the surface. We predict these features using
   the long short-term memory model. Additionally, we use a long time
   series of implied volatility data for S\&P500 index options to train our
   models. We find that two feature construction methods (i.e. sampling the
   surface and variational autoencoders combined with DNN for surface
   construction) are the best performers in the out-of-sample prediction.
   Furthermore, both of them substantially outperform a popular regression
   model. We also find that the DNN model for surface construction not only
   removes static arbitrage but also significantly reduces the prediction
   error compared with a standard interpolation method.},

   the leverage function by a family of feed-forward neural networks and

   This should be seen in the context of neural SDEs and (causal)
   generative adversarial networks: we generate volatility surfaces by
   specific neural SDEs, whose quality is assessed by quantifying, possibly
   in an adversarial manner, distances to market prices. The minimization
   of the calibration functional relies strongly on a variance reduction
   technique based on hedging and deep hedging, which is interesting in its
   own right: it allows the calculation of model prices and model implied
   volatilities in an accurate way using only small sets of sample paths.
   For numerical illustration we implement a SABR-type LSV model and
   conduct a thorough statistical performance analysis on many samples of
   implied volatility smiles, showing the accuracy and stability of the

  abstract                   = {In real markets, generating a smooth implied volatility surface requires
   an interpolation of the calibrated parameters by using smooth parametric
   functions. For this interpolation, practitioners do not use all the
   discrete parameter points but manually select candidate parameter points
   through time-consuming adjustments (e.g., removing outliers, comparing
   with the surface from the previous day, and considering daily market
   indexes) to generate a smooth and robust surface. In this paper, we
   propose neural network models that assist practitioners in generating a
   smooth implied volatility surface under the SABR (Hagan et al., 2002)
   model. Utilizing the selfattention mechanism of a transformer network
   (Vaswani et al., 2017) as a backbone network, we design two models: one
   that orders the parameter points by their likelihood to be selected as
   candidate parameter points and one that determines the candidate point
   set among the combinations of high-priority points. Experimental results
   from a 3-year period of real market S\&P500 and KOSPI200 data show that
   the combination of two models can assist practitioners in the point
   selection task.},

   Autoencoders (VAE) to compress high-dimensional implied volatility
   surfaces into a low dimensional representation. Although this method can
   be effectively used for pricing vanilla options, it does not provide any
   explicit information about the dynamics of the underlying asset. In our
   work we present an effective way to overcome this problem. We use a
   Weighted Monte Carlo approach to first generate paths from a simple a
   priori Brownian dynamics, and then calculate path weights to price
   options correctly. We develop and successfully train a neural network
   that is able to assign these weights directly from the latent space.
   Combining the encoder network of the VAE and this new ``weight
   assigner{''} module, we are able to build a dynamic pricing framework
   which cleanses the volatility surface from irrelevant noise
   fluctuations, and then can price not just vanillas, but also exotic
   options on this idealized vol surface. This pricing method can provide
   relative value signals for option traders.Key findings of the paper: We
   confirmed the success of Variational Autoencoders in compressing
   volatility surfaces into low dimensional latent spaces in the swaption
   market.We successfully extracted the physically meaningful information
   from the latent representation of the market by translating the latent
   coordinates into weights of Monte Carlo paths.We developed a hybrid
   approach by combining Deep Learning and Weighted Monte Carlo that can
   price any type of option consistently with the latent model represented
   by the fully trained VAE.},

   been a hot topic. There are mainly two existing methods: One is to model
   the trend of asset prices in price prediction. Therefore, this method
   inevitably has a lag at the inflection point of the asset sequence. The
   other is to mine market opinion information from the internet to predict
   the future direction of prices. The challenge with this approach is that
   unstructured data processing and analysis is difficult. Therefore, we
   propose a method for asset movement prediction based on SABR {[}3]
   model. On the one hand, the market's prediction of asset trends implied
   in options can be used to solve the hysteresis problem. On the other
   hand, options data is easy to process and analyze. In this article, we
   try to use a neural network model to capture the market's view of the
   future trend of assets hidden in the stochastic volatility surface
   generated by the stochastic volatility model and establish a mapping
   relationship with asset prices. The results show that our methods can
   effectively eliminate the lag of price prediction and improve the
   accuracy of the prediction.},

   jointly yield the corresponding local volatility surface: a finite
   dimensional Gaussian process (GP) regression approach under no-arbitrage
   constraints based on prices, and a neural net (NN) approach with
   penalization of arbitrages based on implied volatilities. We demonstrate
   the performance of these approaches relative to the SSVI industry
   standard. The GP approach is proven arbitrage-free, whereas arbitrages
   are only penalized under the SSVI and NN approaches. The GP approach
   obtains the best out-of-sample calibration error and provides
   uncertainty quantification. The NN approach yields a smoother local
   volatility and a better backtesting performance, as its training
   criterion incorporates a local volatility regularization term.},

   adaptive primal support vector regression (SVR) - to model the implied

   and implementation of an online primal kernel SVR. It features
   enhancements that allow efficient online adaptive learning by embedding
   the idea of local fitness and budget maintenance to dynamically update
   support vectors upon pattern drifts. For algorithm acceleration, we
   implement its most computationally intensive parts in a Field
   Programmable Gate Arrays hardware, where a 132x speedup over CPU is
   achieved during online prediction. Using intraday tick data from the
   E-mini S\&P 500 options market, we show that the Gaussian kernel
   outperforms the linear kernel in regulating the size of support vectors,
   and that our empirical IVS algorithm beats two competing online methods
   with regards to model complexity and regression errors (the mean
   absolute percentage error of our algorithm is up to 13\%). Best results
   are obtained at the center of the IVS grid due to its larger number of
   adjacent support vectors than the edges of the grid. Sensitivity
   analysis is also presented to demonstrate how hyper parameters affect
   the error rates and model complexity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   experienced an unprecedented increase. Finance has not been an
   exception. Several works have been published in recent years using ML
   techniques. However, one of the topics with the least number of
   developed papers is volatility in this context. Nevertheless, the data
   analyzed here suggest changes regarding this issue. Data obtained from
   the Web of Science database show that between 2001 and 2010 there were
   33 published papers associated with this topic. Surprisingly, between
   2019 and 2023, 189 manuscripts have been published related to this
   topic. The purpose of this work is to review the works related to the
   applications of ML in volatility. For this, a classification of the main
   proposals on this topic is proposed following a narrative methodology,
   accompanied by a statistical and bibliometric analysis in which novel
   techniques such as K-means were used. The results are suggestive.
   Although most papers focus on volatility prediction through neural
   networks and support vector machines, there is a lack of studies related
   to volatility transmission, calibration of volatility surfaces, and
   corporate finance. Moreover, the obtained results indicate that there is
   a gap in the production of works related to these topics in finance and
   economics specialized journals.},

   the price of an option based on the no-arbitrage value of a forward
   contract, written on the same underlying asset, and we derive a modified

   related to financial modeling. To overcome the latter issue, we propose
   a Deep Learning approach to efficiently approximate nonlinear functions

   consider solving the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt non-linear stochastic
   differential equation via a forward-backward neural network, also
   calibrating the related stochastic volatility model when dealing with

  abstract                   = {With the development of science and technology, the demand for traffic
   has increased, and the requirements for tunnel excavation have become
   more and more stringent. Tunnel excavation is an important traffic
   construction engineering technology. Due to the influence of many
   factors in the excavation process, surface settlement or deformation
   will inevitably occur, so its deformation must be predicted in real time
   to prevent safety accidents and property losses. The previous numerical
   methods and neural network methods cannot accurately predict in real
   time, and the intelligent neural network model can more accurately
   predict the deformation of the ground because of the characteristics of
   adaptive organizational learning according to different situations and
   different environments. This article aims to study and design an
   intelligent neural network model to predict and calculate the amount of
   ground deformation caused by the tunnel excavation process. An
   intelligent neural network model with more accurate prediction is
   proposed, and simulation experiments are carried out on tunnel
   excavation of different terrains, and the accuracy of the model for
   predicting the deformation amount is calculated. The experimental
   results show that the prediction error range of the model is 10 times
   smaller than that of the traditional neural network. The prediction
   accuracy of this model is above 95\%, and the volatility rate of
   prediction accuracy is lower than 11\%, while the volatility rate of
   traditional prediction accuracy is even more than 365\%. The intelligent
   neural network model can effectively predict the deformation of tunnel
   excavation.},

   the context of financial time series of curves or surfaces. (It is also
   applicable in higher dimensions, at least in theory.) In particular, we
   introduce an original architecture amenable to the treatment of data
   defined at variable grid nodes (by far the most common situation in
   financial nowcasting applications, where principal component analysis
   (PCA) and classical autoencoder methods are not applicable). This is
   illustrated by three case studies on real data sets. First, we introduce
   our approach on repurchase agreement curves data (with a moving
   time-to-maturity as calendar time passes). Second, we show that our
   approach outperforms elementary interpolation benchmarks on an equity
   derivative surfaces data set (again, with a moving time-to-maturity). We
   also obtain a satisfying performance for outlier detection and surface
   completion. Third, we benchmark our approach against PCA on at-the-money
   swaption surfaces redefined at constant expiry/tenor grid nodes. Our
   approach is then shown to perform as well as (even if not obviously
   better than) the PCA (which, however, is not applicable to the native,
   raw data defined on a moving time-to-expiry grid).},

   surfaces. Given any fitted parametric option pricing model, we train a
   feedforward neural network on the model-implied pricing errors to
   correct for mispricing and boost performance. Using a large dataset of
   S\&P 500 options, we test our nonparametric correction on several
   parametric models ranging from ad-hoc Black-Scholes to structural
   stochastic volatility models and demonstrate the boosted performance for
   each model. Out-of-sample prediction exercises in the cross-section and
   in the option panel show that machine-corrected models always outperform
   their respective original ones, often by a large extent. Our method is
   relatively indiscriminate, bringing pricing errors down to a similar
   magnitude regardless of the misspecification of the original parametric
   model. Even so, correcting models that are less misspecified usually
   leads to additional improvements in performance and also outperforms a
   neural network fitted directly to the implied volatility surface.},

   the two oil blends containing the selected additives were formulated and
   tested. The results show that both POME and graphite nanoflakes could be
   potential friction modifiers. Notably, the four-ball tribometer test
   reveals that the addition of 7 vol\% of POME to naphthenic oil and 0.01
   wt\% graphite nanoflakes to naphthenic oil results in the reduction of
   wear scar diameter by 24\% and 59\%, respectively. Surface micrographs
   of aluminum workpiece subjected to simple turning operation in a CNC
   machine corroborated the wear test results. POME in naphthenic oil
   resulted in better surface finish relative to POME-formulated groundnut
   oil. The experimental data were analyzed using artificial neural network
   (ANN) to gain a better understanding of the entire work. The sensitivity
   analysis developed from the chosen ANN models exhibited the nature of
   influence of the input parameters (groundnut concentrations, POME, and
   naphthenic oil) on the outputs (Noack volatility, thermal conductivity,
   and wear).},

   learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge across networks. This study
   evaluates the efficacy of ImageNet pretrained state-of-the-art networks,
   including DenseNet, ResNet, and VGG, in implementing transfer learning
   for prepruned models on compact datasets, such as Fashion MNIST,
   CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. The primary objective is to reduce the number of
   neurons while preserving high-level features. To this end, local
   sensitivity analysis is employed alongside p-norms and various reduction
   levels. This investigation discovers that VGG16, a network rich in
   parameters, displays resilience to high-level feature pruning.
   Conversely, the ResNet architectures reveal an interesting pattern of
   increased volatility. These observations assist in identifying an
   optimal combination of the norm and the reduction level for each network
   architecture, thus offering valuable directions for model-specific
   optimization. This study marks a significant advance in understanding
   and implementing effective pruning strategies across diverse network
   architectures, paving the way for future research and applications.},

  abstract                   = {Copper is one of the valuable natural resources, and it was widely used
   in many different industries. The complicated fluctuations of copper
   prices can significantly affect other industries. Therefore, this study
   aims to develop and propose several forecast models for forecasting
   monthly copper prices in the future based on various algorithms in
   machine learning, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network,
   k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), gradient
   boosting tree (GBT), and random forest (RF). The monthly copper price
   dataset from January 1990 to December 2019 was collected for this aim
   based on other metals and natural gas prices. In addition, the influence
   of currency exchange rates of the countries that have the largest copper
   production around the world was also taken into account and used as
   input variables for forecasting copper price. The different set of
   predictors (t, t-1, t-2, t-3, t-4. t-5) were considered to forecast
   monthly copper prices based on the mentioned machine learning
   techniques. The results revealed that the currency exchange rates of the
   countries that have the most abundant copper production around the world
   have a significant effect on the volatility of monthly copper prices in
   the world, and they should be used to forecast monthly copper prices in
   the future. A comprehensive comparison of various machine learning
   techniques shows that MLP neural network (with deep learning techniques)
   is the best method for forecasting monthly copper price with an MAE of
   228.617 and RMSE of 287.539. Whereas, the other models, such as SVM, RF,
   KNN, and GBT, provided higher errors with an MAE in the range of
   308.691-453.147, RMSE in the range of 393.599-552.208. In this sense,
   MLP neural network can be used as a reliable tool to forecast copper
   prices in the future.},

   their applications in various organic reactions. A 12-tungstophosphoric
   acid (TPA) is a member of heteropoly acid (HPA) compounds, which grabbed
   attention because of its low volatility, low corrosivity, higher
   activity, and acidity compared to sulfuric acid. However, the major
   problems of using TPA are its solubility in polar media, and its lower
   surface area. Therefore, various techniques are applied to use it as
   heterogeneous catalysts. Biodiesel is a diesel substitute renewable
   fuel, which is produced from various renewable feedstocks through
   transesterification or esterification reactions. Acid catalysts can
   catalyze both transesterification and esterification reactions. For this
   reason, research has been conducted to study the catalytic activity of
   various TPA precursory solid acid catalysts for biodiesel production. In
   this Review, a data mining technique has been applied to extract
   valuable information from the previously published literature. For this
   purpose, an artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed
   based on the published research data to capture the general trends or to
   make predictions. Both catalyst properties and reaction conditions are
   trended and predicted using the network model.},

  abstract                   = {Objective: The aim of this work was to develop a based
   microwave-assisted approach for extraction of isoflavonoids from the
   herbal medicines.
   Background: Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) as a design green
   solvent are regarded as an attractive alternative or replacement to
   conventional volatile organic solvents. The microwave-assisted
   extraction has been applied widely to extract natural products. But the
   extracting solvents used often include organic solvents, which have
   strong volatility and toxicity and can cause serious pollution issues.
   The extraction technique that combines microwave extraction technology
   with ionic liquids for application in the field of extraction and
   separation constitutes a new approach.
   Method: {[}bmim]Br was selected as the solvent. The microwave-assisted
   extraction parameters, including extraction time, extraction
   temperature, microwave power, and the concentration of {[}bmim]Br had
   been concerned. Response surface methodology was used to develop
   predictive models for simulation and optimization of the extraction
   process. The multivariate quadratic regression equation was obtained by
   Central Composite Design. The response surfaces were determined by using
   the yields of total isoflavonoids as response values. HPLC and SEM were
   performed to compare the ionic liquid based microwave extraction with
   the traditional alcohol MAE.
   Results: The optimum extraction conditions were: extraction temperature
   of 70oC, extraction time of 8 min, microwave power of 400 W, and the
   concentration of {[}bmim]Br of 1.2 mol/L. The extraction yield of total
   isoflavonoids was 10.09\%, which is well in close agreement with the
   value predicted by the model. Conclusion: Compared to conventional
   organic solvents, the ionic liquid based MAE could provide higher
   extraction yields and take much shorter extraction time. (C) 2014

   are highly correlated. With the continuous development process of crack,
   the stress state of rock is constantly broken until entirely failed, so
   it is necessary to study the spatial and temporal behavior

   paper, the destruction process of phyllite specimens is analyzed by
   thermal imaging technology, and the temperature evolution process of the
   crack is studied to explore the infrared characteristics of the crack
   evolution process. Furthermore, a model for predicting rock destruction
   time is proposed based on Bi-LSTM recurrent neural network model
   combined with Attention mechanism. The results show that: (1) During the
   development of rock cracks, the rock surface shows a stable dynamic
   infrared response, and shows different evolutionary characteristics in
   different stages, mainly including temperature reduction in the
   compaction stage, temperature rise in the elastic and plastic stages,
   and temperature peaks in the failure stage; (2) During the evolution of
   the crack, rock destruction has a significant control effect on the IRT
   field along the fracture tangential and normal direction, and its
   distribution has the volatility controlled by the time; (3) The
   recurrent neural network method is used to predict the rock failure
   time, the results can be used as a method to predict the time of rock
   destruction, and it can be further put forward the corresponding
   protective measures accordingly, to maintain the long-term stability of

   anxiety reveals a potential role for oscillations in the anterior

   Anxiety has been linked to altered belief formation and uncertainty
   estimation, impacting learning. Identifying the neural processes
   underlying these changes is important for understanding brain pathology.
   Here, we show that oscillatory activity in the medial prefrontal,
   anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex (mPFC, ACC, OFC) explains
   anxiety-related learning alterations. In a magnetoencephalography
   experiment, two groups of human participants pre-screened with high and
   low trait anxiety (HTA, LTA: 39) performed a probabilistic reward-based
   learning task. HTA undermined learning through an overestimation of
   volatility, leading to faster belief updating, more stochastic decisions
   and pronounced lose-shift tendencies. On a neural level, we observed
   increased gamma activity in the ACC, dmPFC, and OFC during encoding of
   precision-weighted prediction errors in HTA, accompanied by suppressed
   ACC alpha/beta activity. Our findings support the association between
   altered learning and belief updating in anxiety and changes in gamma and
   alpha/beta activity in the ACC, dmPFC, and OFC.},

  abstract                   = {This paper reports a comprehensive study on the fabrication of titanium
   dioxide-based memristors, patterned using electron beam lithography
   method. Memristor, one of the state-of-the-art technology devices with
   non-volatile memory, has gained significant attention in recent years.
   The properties of the memristor, such as non-volatility, high speed, and
   low cost, allow it to simplify memory and storage hierarchy. Hence, they
   are ideal for performing bio-inspired neural networks through their
   ability to combine memory and computation in one physical structure. For
   memristors to be used as an electronic component in various
   applications, it is necessary to go beyond laboratory research studies.
   Therefore, it is essential to develop the fabrication process so as to
   enable the mass production of these devices. In this context, various
   optimization studies were carried out primarily to provide that the
   structures of memristor successfully show memristive behavior during the
   fabrication process steps. Throughout the fabrication process, the
   bottom electrode, active layer, and top electrode of memristors were
   patterned by using electron beam lithography. In addition, the
   sputtering method is used for the deposition of electrodes, and the
   atomic layer deposition method is used for the active layer. Following
   the fabrication process, scanning electron microscopy is used to
   characterize the surface properties of the memristor structure.
   Current-voltage measurements were carried out to characterize the
   electrical behaviors of memristors and to test their endurance. As a
   result of measurements, the fabricated devices have shown memristive
   behavior successfully and good endurance for 1000 cycles.},

  abstract                   = {Prior surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) research has shown that
   pre-processing is necessary before analysis. Pre-processing also
   typically serves the dual purposes of removing the auto-fluorescence
   background and minimizing data volatility. This method allows for a more
   accurate comparison of spectral traits and relative SERS peak strength.
   However, because there are so many different kinds of samples, it can
   take a long time, and there is no assurance that the approach chosen
   will work well with a particular kind of sample. Therefore, this study
   employed a deep learning technique called multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
   to simplify the pre-processing of blood plasma SERS samples in patients
   with prostate cancer (PC), as well as to enhance the sensitivity and
   specificity of diagnosis using SERS technology. First of all,
   significant variations in peak intensity can be observed in the
   difference spectra, facilitating differentiation between PC and normal
   groups. Second, the data analysis was carried out in three different
   stages (raw data, defluorescenced data, and normalized data) using
   principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA),
   as well as PCA-multi-layer perceptron (PCAMLP). Finally, when SERS data
   was analyzed using PCA-LDA, there were significant differences in
   classification accuracy across each stage (The classification accuracy
   of three different stages were 76.90\%, 85.60\%, 95.20\%, respectively).
   However, when PCA-MLP was utilized for SERS data analysis, the
   classification accuracy remained consistently high and stable (The
   classification accuracy of three different stages were 92.00\%, 92.40\%,
   96.70\%,},

  abstract                   = {Water plays an essential role in aerosol chemistry, gas-particle
   partitioning, and particle viscosity, but it is typically omitted in
   thermodynamic models describing the mixing within organic aerosol phases
   and the partitioning of semivolatile organics. In this study, we
   introduce the Binary Activity Thermodynamics (BAT) model, a
   water-sensitive reduced-complexity model treating the nonideal mixing of
   water and organics. The BAT model can process different levels of
   physicochemical mixture information enabling its application in the
   thermodynamic aerosol treatment within chemical transport models, the
   evaluation of humidity effects in environmental chamber studies, and the
   analysis of field observations. It is capable of using organic structure
   information including O : C, H : C, molar mass, and vapor pressure,
   which can be derived from identified compounds or estimated from bulk
   aerosol properties. A key feature of the BAT model is predicting the
   extent of liquid-liquid phase separation occurring within aqueous
   mixtures containing hydrophobic organics. This is crucial to simulating
   the abrupt change in water uptake behavior of moderately hygroscopic
   organics at high relative humidity, which is essential for capturing the
   correct behavior of organic aerosols serving as cloud condensation
   nuclei. For gas-particle partitioning predictions, we complement a
   volatility basis set (VBS) approach with the BAT model to account for
   nonideality and liquid-liquid equilibrium effects. To improve the
   computational efficiency of this approach, we trained two neural
   networks; the first for the prediction of aerosol water content at given
   relative humidity, and the second for the partitioning of semivolatile
   components. The integrated VBS + BAT model is benchmarked against
   high-fidelity molecular-level gasparticle equilibrium calculations based
   on the AIOMFAC Aerosol Inorganic-Organic Mixtures Functional groups
   Activity Coefficient) model. Organic aerosol systems derived from
   alpha-pinene or isoprene oxidation are used for comparison. Predicted
   organic mass concentrations agree within less than a 5\% error in the
   isoprene case, which is a significant improvement over a traditional VBS
   implementation. In the case of the alpha-pinene system, the error is
   less than 2\% up to a relative humidity of 94\%, with larger errors past
   that point. The goal of the BAT model is to represent the bulk O : C and
   molar mass dependencies of a wide range of water-organic mixtures to a
   reasonable degree of accuracy. In this context, we discuss that the
   reduced-complexity effort may be poor at representing a specific binary
   water-organic mixture perfectly. However, the averaging effects of our
   reduced-complexity model become more representative when the mixture
   diversity increases in terms of organic functionality and number of
   components.},

   components are integral to understanding and modelling climate and
   health-relevant aerosol physicochemical properties, such as volatility,
   hygroscopicity, light scattering and toxicity. This study presents a
   synthesis analysis for eight data sets, of non-refractory aerosol
   composition, measured at a boreal forest site. The measurements,
   performed with an aerosol mass spectrometer, cover in total around 9
   months over the course of 3 years. In our statistical analysis, we use
   the complete organic and inorganic unit-resolution mass spectra, as
   opposed to the more common approach of only including the organic
   fraction. The analysis is based on iterative, combined use of (1) data
   reduction, (2) classification and (3) scaling tools, producing a
   data-driven chemical mass balance type of model capable of describing
   site-specific aerosol composition. The receptor model we constructed was
   able to explain 83 +/- 8\% of variation in data, which increased to 96
   +/- 3\% when signals from low signal-to-noise variables were not
   considered. The resulting interpretation of an extensive set of aerosol
   mass spectrometric data infers seven distinct aerosol chemical
   components for a rural boreal forest site: ammonium sulfate (35 +/- 7\%
   of mass), low and semi-volatile oxidised organic aerosols (27 +/- 8\%
   and 12 +/- 7 \%), biomass burning organic aerosol (11 +/- 7 \%), a
   nitrate-containing organic aerosol type (7 +/- 2 \%), ammonium nitrate
   (5 +/- 2 \%), and hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (3 +/- 1 \%). Some of
   the additionally observed, rare outlier aerosol types likely emerge due
   to surface ionisation effects and likely represent amine compounds from
   an unknown source and alkaline metals from emissions of a nearby
   district heating plant. Compared to traditional, ionbalance-based
   inorganics apportionment schemes for aerosol mass spectrometer data, our
   statistics-based method provides an improved, more robust approach,
   yielding readily useful information for the modelling of submicron
   atmospheric aerosols physical and chemical properties. The results also
   shed light on the division between organic and inorganic aerosol types
   and dynamics of salt formation in aerosol. Equally importantly, the
   combined methodology exemplifies an iterative analysis, using consequent
   analysis steps by a combination of statistical methods. Such an approach
   offers new ways to home in on physicochemically sensible solutions with
   minimal need for a priori information or analyst interference. We
   therefore suggest that similar statisticsbased approaches offer
   significant potential for un- or semi-supervised machine-learning
   applications in future analyses of aerosol mass spectrometric data.},

   damage, affecting in particular those who invested in companies that
   eventually filed for bankruptcy. A better understanding of stocks that
   become bankrupt would be helpful in reducing risk in future investments.
   Economists have conducted extensive research on this topic, and here we
   ask whether statistical physics concepts and approaches may offer
   insights into pre-bankruptcy stock behavior. To this end, we study all
   20092 stocks listed in US stock markets for the 20-year period
   1989-2008, including 4223 (21 percent) that became bankrupt during that
   period. We find that, surprisingly, the distributions of the daily
   returns of those stocks that become bankrupt differ significantly from
   those that do not. Moreover, these differences are consistent for the
   entire period studied. We further study the relation between the
   distribution of returns and the length of time until bankruptcy, and
   observe that larger differences of the distribution of returns correlate
   with shorter time periods preceding bankruptcy. This behavior suggests
   that sharper fluctuations in the stock price occur when the stock is
   closer to bankruptcy. We also analyze the cross-correlations between the
   return and the trading volume, and find that stocks approaching
   bankruptcy tend to have larger return-volume cross-correlations than
   stocks that are not. Furthermore, the difference increases as bankruptcy
   approaches. We conclude that before a firm becomes bankrupt its stock
   exhibits unusual behavior that is statistically quantifiable. Copyright

  abstract  = {We present a neural network-based calibration method that performs the calibration task within a few milliseconds for the full implied volatility surface. The framework is consistently applicable throughout a range of volatility models—including second-generation stochastic volatility models and the rough volatility family—and a range of derivative contracts. Neural networks in this work are used in an off-line approximation of complex pricing functions, which are difficult to represent or time-consuming to evaluate by other means. The form in which information from available data is extracted and used influences network performance: The grid-based algorithm used for calibration is inspired by representing the implied volatility and option prices as a collection of pixels. We highlight how this perspective opens new horizons for quantitative modelling. The calibration bottleneck posed by a slow pricing of derivative contracts is lifted, and stochastic volatility models (classical and rough) can be handled in great generality as the framework also allows taking the forward variance curve as an input. We demonstrate the calibration performance both on simulated and historical data, on different derivative contracts and on a number of example models of increasing complexity, and also showcase some of the potentials of this approach towards model recognition. The algorithm and examples are provided in the Github repository GitHub: NN-StochVol-Calibrations.},
